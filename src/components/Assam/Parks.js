                World Heritage Site in 1985 and a Biosphere Reserve in 1989,
                this national park covers an expansive 500 sq. km and serves as
                the core area of the Chirang Ripu Elephant Reserve, spanning
                over 2600 sq. km. Manas is home to over 22 endangered species,
                designated as Schedule 1 species in the Wildlife Protection Act
                and afforded the highest level of protection. The park's natural
                beauty is renowned, earning it a UNESCO World Heritage Tag
                declaration as a site of exceptional natural beauty and
                aesthetic importance. With over 500 bird species, Manas is also
                recognized as an Important Bird Area. UNESCO's recognition of

                through its exceptional natural phenomena and diverse array of
                flora and fauna.

                Covering an area of 111.19 sq. km across the Dibrugarh and
                Tinsukia districts, the National Park is renowned for its Assam
                Valley Tropical Wet Evergreen Forests that border Arunachal
                Pradesh. As part of the Dehing-Patkai Elephant Reserve, the park
                is home to a diverse range of wildlife and flora. Nearby
                attractions include World War II cemeteries, the historic
                Stillwell Road, and the oldest refinery in Asia, located in
                Digboi. However, the park is also faced with the challenge of
                'open cast' coal mining at Lido. Despite this, the park remains
                a captivating destination for visitors seeking to explore the
                unique ecosystem of the Assam Valley Tropical Wet Evergreen
                Forests and the vibrant wildlife that call it home.
