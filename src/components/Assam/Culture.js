            Culture of Assam
          </h2>
          <hr></hr>
          <p>
            Assam is a melting pot of various cultures, boasting a rich and
            diverse heritage. The people of this captivating state are an
            amalgamation of different racial stocks, including Mongoloid,
            Indo-Burmese, Indo-Iranian, and Aryan. Over time, this assimilative
            process has given rise to a unique and fascinating tapestry of
            Assamese culture.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The natives of Assam, known as "Asomiya," speak the state language
            of Assamese. Assam is home to a large number of tribes, each with
            its own unique tradition, culture, dress, and way of life. Among the
            tribes coexisting in Assam are the Bodo, Kachari, Karbi, Miri,
            Mishimi, and Rabha, each with their own language, though Assamese is
            the principal language of the state.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The Vaishnavas, a sect of Hinduism, are the majority religious group
            in Assam. They do not believe in idol worshiping and instead perform
            "Naamkirtana," where the glory of Lord Vishnu is recited. The two
            most important cultural and religious institutions that influence
            the cultural fabric of Assam are the "Satras," religious and
            cultural practice sites that have been in existence for over 400
            years, and the "Naamghar," houses of prayer. Villagers generally
            associate on the basis of membership of a local Centre of devotional
            worship called "Naamghar." Villages are usually made up of families
            from a number of distinct castes, although the caste system is not
            as prominent in Assam as it is in other parts of India.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Assam is also home to a diverse range of religions, including
            Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam. The state festival of
            Assam is Bihu, which is celebrated in three parts during the year
            with great pomp and grandeur by all Assamese, irrespective of caste,
            creed, or religion.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Various elements represent Assamese beliefs, feelings, pride, and
            identity and are considered important symbolic elements in Assamese
            culture. The quintessential symbols of Assamese culture include the
            "Gamucha," "Jaapi," "TamulPaan," and "Xorai." Traditional attire
            worn by women, called the "Mekhela Chador," and Assamese jewelry
            also form an integral part of the Assamese culture.

              <p>
                The "Gamucha" is a ubiquitous cultural symbol of Assam, woven
                into the fabric of almost all socio-religious ceremonies.
                Honored as a piece of cloth, it is commonly used for
                felicitation in the region. This white rectangular cotton cloth,
                hand-woven with a primarily red border on three sides and red
                woven motifs on the fourth (in addition to other colors), serves
                numerous purposes. It functions as a towel, waistcloth or
                loincloth; Bihu dancers knot it around their heads, while it
                hangs around the neck at the prayer hall and thrown over the
                shoulder to signify social status or respect. During Bihu,
                "Gamuchas," also known as "Bihuwaans," are offered as a token of
                love. What's more, the "Gamucha" is a unifying symbol, as it is
                used equally by people from all religious and ethnic
                backgrounds.

              <p>
                "Tamul Paan," a combination of areca nut and betel leaves, also
                known as Guapan, is a symbol of devotion, respect, and
                friendship. In Assam, guests are offered "Tamul Paan" in a
                traditional bell metal serving vessel known as "Bota" as a mark
                of honor. Chewing "Tamul Paan" produces a pleasant feeling and a
                euphoric high. It is an integral part of all social and
                religious ceremonies of the Assamese people, steeped in an
                ancient tradition that has been followed since time immemorial.

              <p>
                The "Jaapi" is a traditional conical hat from Assam, crafted
                from tightly woven bamboo and/or cane, and "Tokoupaat," a type
                of large palm leaf. The word "Jaapi" derives from the term
                "Jaap," meaning a bundle of Tokou leaves. It serves several
                purposes, such as being worn as a style of Bihu dance, used as
                protection against the elements, offered as a sign of respect in
                ceremonies, and placed as a decorative item around the house,
                especially near the front door as a welcoming sign. Farmers used
                plain "Jaapi" for shielding themselves from the sun and rain
                while working in the fields, while ornate "Jaapi" were worn as a
                symbol of status by Assamese royalty and nobility.

              <p>
                The "Xorai" is a traditional symbol of Assam and is made of
                bell-metal, valued as an article of great respect by the people.
                They come with or without a top cover and are manufactured
                primarily in Hajo and Sarthebari, the most significant centers
                of traditional bell-metal and brass crafts in Assam.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                "Xorai" is used to offer "Tamul Paan" as a gesture of welcome
                and gratitude to guests. It is also used as a utensil to offer
                Prasad, food, and other items in front of the Lord in an altar
                or "Naamghar." "Xorai" also serves as a decorative item and is
                given as a gift to a person of honor during felicitations.

                Assam boasts several types of silks, including the most
                prestigious "Muga," a natural golden silk exclusive only to
                Assam. Additionally, there are two other varieties: "Paat," a
                creamy-bright-silver colored silk, and "Eri," used to make warm
                winter clothing.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Sualkuchi is the center for the traditional silk industry, but
                rural households throughout the Brahmaputra Valley also produce
                silk and silk garments with exceptional woven designs. Assam is
                also home to various ethno-cultural groups who make unique
                cotton garments with beautiful color combinations and woven
                designs.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Traditionally, Mekhela Chadors are made from Cotton, Muga, Paat
                Silk or Eri Silk. However, modern low-budget options may blend
                Cotton and Muga or Paat Silk with synthetic materials.
